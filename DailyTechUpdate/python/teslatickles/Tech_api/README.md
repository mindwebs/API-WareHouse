**Tech Article Aggregator Scraper API**

- Written in Python (3)
- Uses Beautiful Soup (4) and Requests to scrape a tech aggregator website
- Produces an array ('list', if were talking Pythonically) of JSON objects.

**Executing the API**

To execute this API:

- clone this repo
- navigate to teslatickles/Tech_api in terminal/command line
- type `python techgrab.py`
- press enter/return on keyboard

This will result in generating a file `techlinks.txt`.
Since there is an included example of this file, the contents will simply be overwritten with the new data scraped from the [techurls](www.techurls.com) webpage.

**Structure of JSON**

*Returns approximately 360 objects with each one representing a tech article*

_Structure:_

{

    "title": "Practicing Python",
    "link": "https://realpython.com",
    "publisher": "teslatickles"
}

``[{"title": title of article, "link": link to article, "publisher": publisher of article}]``

_Example:_

``[{"title": "Interested in improving your relationships? Try Nonviolent Communication", "link": "https://www.clearerthinking.org/single-post/2019/03/06/Want-to-improve-your-relationships-Try-Nonviolent-Communication-1", "publisher": "cnet"}, {}, ...]``

**Output Generated By API**

This API generates a file named `techlinks.txt`.

There is an example of this file included in the repo. Every time the the API is ran, this file is overwritten with the output generated at that time (the data scraped from the aggregator site).
